# ARGUS: API Vulnerability Scanner

ARGUS is an API vulnerability scanner designed to identify security weaknesses in APIs by testing for the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. It automates the process of finding common API flaws, ensuring robust security and providing detailed reports for remediation.

## Features

- **OWASP Top 10 Coverage**: Detect vulnerabilities like injection flaws, authentication issues, sensitive data exposure, and more.
- **Automated Testing**: Perform scans with minimal setup.
- **Customizable Scanning**: Specify target endpoints and customize scan configurations.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate comprehensive reports with findings and recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple to use for developers and security professionals.
